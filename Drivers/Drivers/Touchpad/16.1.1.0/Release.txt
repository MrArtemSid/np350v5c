Version  8.0.2 04/01/2005 (Win9x&ME/WinNT/Win2K/WinXP)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Fixes
  -Merged AutoDisable registry keys into a single key.  All inf files were
   updated to use the new key.

   translation. 
  -Fixed a minor bug to set correct default value for button swap state. 
  -Added code to cause us to update the display rotation on init, login, and
   fast user switch since we are no longer calling PersistState() when we
   change display rotation. 
  -Fulfill a platform setting change request for customer. 
  -Repaired Russian translations

Known Defect

   edition due to a OS service not being available in Windows 98. 
  -Translated and corrected some Russian words 
  -Fixed DisableIntPDIfExtPnpPDPresent registry key location. 
  -Removed PersistState call in HandleDisplayRotation since this was
   being applied before we had gotten the login msg for Fast User Switching

   RestoreState for user2. 
  -PNGs now display. 
  -Correct Russian translation errors.
  -Add ODM specific platforms and settings. 
  -Remove compatible IDs for OEM
  -Decreased default PTS sensitivity to the point where my personal actual
   and spurious error rates are approximately equal. Also decreased the
